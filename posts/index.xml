      <description>While coding professionally I&amp;rsquo;ve used Gradle, Maven, and Ant. I think Gradle is my least favorite.
There have been a couple good critiques of Gradle that I&amp;rsquo;ve read lately. I want to note them here for completeness, but then move on to outline my own frustrations which come from a different angle.
First there is this article by Bruce Eckel. The central argument really spoke to me and got me thinking about this topic.</description>

      <description>One of the most common anti-patterns in software development is something that looks like this:
val tribble = getTribble(id) if (tribble == null) return In some contexts this type of code is fine, but in most it is not. It is a silent failure, which is the worst type of failure!
What is null? First what is a null Tribble? While Kotlin certainly supports richer ways of communicating errors, it comes from the tradition of Java and C, so usually uses null to represent the absence of a thing.</description>
